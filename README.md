# üêç Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning (C++ & Raylib)

This is a classic **Snake Game** implemented in **C++ using Raylib**, now enhanced with a **Q-Learning Agent** based on **Reinforcement Learning** principles. The game allows the snake to learn how to survive and score points through experience.

## üß† Reinforcement Learning Integration

- The snake is controlled by a **Q-Learning Agent** that learns from **reward signals**.
- The **agent** chooses actions based on an **epsilon-greedy policy** (exploration vs. exploitation).
- The **Q-table** is updated during gameplay using the **Bellman equation**.
- Over time, the snake learns how to **maximize its score** while avoiding collisions.

### üî¢ Q-Learning Key Concepts

- **State**: The current environment the snake is in (e.g. its position, direction, food location).
- **Action**: Move `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, or `Right`.
- **Reward**: Positive for eating food, negative for hitting walls or itself.
- **Update Rule**:

## üéÆ Gameplay

- Control the snake using **arrow keys** or switch to **AI mode** to let the Q-agent take over.
- Eat the food to grow and increase your score.
- The snake **wraps around the screen** if it hits the wall.
- The game ends if the snake **collides with itself**.
